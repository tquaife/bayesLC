# bayesLC
Code for calculating uncertainties on satellite based land cover, as described in the following papers:

[Cripps, E., Oâ€™Hagan, A., & Quaife, T. (2013). Quantifying uncertainty in remotely sensed land cover maps. Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 27(5), 1239-1251.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00477-012-0660-3)

[Quaife, T., & Cripps, E. (2016). Bayesian analysis of uncertainty in the GlobCover 2009 land cover product at climate model grid scale. Remote Sensing, 8(4), 314.](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/4/314)

## Usage
 
usage: bayeslc \[options\] control_file.txt > output.txt

The control file must be the last word on the command line.

Options are:

`-d %f`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        set the correlation factor to %f<br>
`-l %d`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       set the length for the conditional auto regressive model to %d<br>
`-n %d`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        set the number of simulations to %d (the higher the better)<br>
`-u`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           display this message<br>

The format of the control file is a series of ascii text lines each specifying user
defined input and output filenames. Anything after a # character is treated as a comment.
Blank lines, or lines consisting only of a comment are ignored. Excluding these
the following information is expected, in order:

Line 1: a list of N files containing the input LC proportions<br>
Line 2: a mask file containing 0 where a mask is to be applied and 1 elsewhere<br>
Line 3: a file containing an NxN confusion matrix<br>
Line 4: a file containing the number of "counts"<br>
Line 5: a list of N files to contain the output means<br>
Line 6: a list of N files to contain the output stdvs<br>

Aside from the confusion matrix (which is an NxN ascii matrix) all the input files are plain, headerless
ascii text files containing a single matrix, each of which must have the same dimensions as the rest.

The total area of each land cover class for each simulation is written to the stdout. 

## Example

The example_data directory contains input data for a small portion of southern Africa. This can be run using the following command:

```bayeslc -n 100 control.txt > ouput.txt```

The file `control.txt` contains comments explaining the content of each line. Increase the value after the `-n` to produce increase
the number of samples, the greater the number the better represented the posterior distribution will be, but the longer 
the run will take. In Quaife and Cripps (2016) we used a value of 10000.

A quick and dirty python script `showImg.py` is included to view the input and output maps.

## License

This is open source software (see the license for full details). You can use it without any obligation to the authors. 
However, if you want help implementing it for a given application we're happy to discuss.

## Install

I have only ever tried installing on Linux. The only dependency is the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). As long as you have the GSL and standard development tools installed (specifically `gcc` and `make`) it should just be a case of typing `make`.
