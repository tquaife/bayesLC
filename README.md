# bayesLC
Code for calculating uncertainties on satellite based land cover, as described in the following papers:

##Usage

usage: bayeslc \[options\] control_file.txt

The control file must be the last word on the command line.
Options are:
-d %f        set the correlation factor to %f
-l %d        set the length for the conditional auto regressive model to %d
-n %d        set the number of simulations to %d (the higher the better)
-u           display this message

The format of the control file is a series of ascii text lines each specifying user
defined input and output filenames. Anything after a # character is treated as a comment.
Blank lines, or lines consisting only of a comment are ignored. Excluding these
the following information is expected, in order:

Line 1: a list of N files containing the input LC porportions
Line 2: a mask file containing 0 where a mask is to be applied and 1 elsewhere
Line 3: a file containing an NxN confusion matrix
Line 4: a file containing the number of "counts"
Line 5: a list of N files to contain the output means
Line 6: a list of N files to contain the output stdvs

Aside from the confusion matrix (which is an NxN ascii matrix) all the input files are plain, headerless
ascii text files containg a single matrix, each of which must have the same dimensions as the rest.
